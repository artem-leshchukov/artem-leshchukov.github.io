title: Refactoring. Growth.
---

During a software engineer career, everybody faces the problem of dealing with the code they've written a long time ago. So was I. And recently this happened to me. 

So, at my job after working on a new project for a couple of months, I returned to the old one to add a new functionality. I've looked at my old piece of code and was shocked by how unskilled I was when writing this *disaster*. Immediately I noticed that it can be (somewhere
*should* be) modified at *every 10th* line of code. 

And at first, I did exactly this - I began to change every line where I observed some kind of slow-performance code, bad architecture
design, misnaming of variables and functions, etc. So, when I finished doing it after 3 hours or so, I was truly glad that I "fixed" it.
But after 10 seconds of pure satisfaction from done work, I thought: "Wait, was it my task? Why did I spend roughly half of a working day
on refactoring the code just because I wanted or decided to do so?".

Look, I mean that it's not a problem to notice bad decisions in your old code. The **problem** is to fix it right away in cases when: 
1) it takes too much time to refactor it *and* 2) you do it at will (without informing your colleagues/managers and without thoroughly
reflecting on the priority of doing it now). Therefore, I think that it's *okay to refactor* your old code only if: 1) it would take as
little time as possible or 2) you discussed with your colleagues that it would be good to do so and you add refactoring as a task.

An important note, I look at this from the perspective of writing your old project solely. If an old project was written by you and some
other programmer, and you noticed a thing to modify - it's up to you alone whether to change it or first discuss it with him/her.

*Growth* - a topic that correlates with what I described above. Namely, the growth as a software developer/engineer (whatever you call
yourself). I believe that looking at code (not only yours) and noticing different mistakes there (or wrong/inappropriate ways of 
achieving a desired result) will certainly improve you as a programmer. This process is *required* for growth.

If only we have *a chance to indefinitely improve our code* - we would do it **forever** because every time we look at the code we come
up with (mostly better) new algorithms to solve the problem, new names for classes/functions, new architecture decisions, and so on. And
it's fine - it just means that we *learn* and become more and more *proficient* in our craft. But you should *never stop on your one 
project or one piece of code*. It's vital to keep going, learn from your mistakes, and apply knowledge to new projects.
